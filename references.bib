	abstract = {This study examines the global air travel demand pattern using complex network analysis. Using the data for the top 50 airports based on passenger volume rankings, we investigate the relationship between network measures of nodes (airports) in the global flight network and their passenger volume. The analysis explores the network measures at various spatial scales, from individual airports to metropolitan areas and countries. Different attributes, such as flight route length and the number of airlines, are considered in the analysis. Certain attributes are found to be more relevant than others, and specific network measure models are found to better capture the dynamics of global air travel demand than others. Among the models, PageRank is found to be the most correlated with total passenger volume. Moreover, distance-based measures perform worse than the ones emphasising the number of airlines, particularly those counting the number of airlines operating a route, including codeshare. Using the PageRank score weighted by the number of airlines, we find that airports in Asian cities tend to have more traffic than expected, while European and North American airports have the potential to attract more passenger volume given their connectivity pattern. Additionally, we combine the network measures with socio-economic variables such as population and GDP to show that the network measures could greatly augment the traditional approaches to modelling and predicting air travel demand. We’ll also briefly discuss the implications of the findings in this study for airport planning and airline industry strategy.},

Since the introduction of complex network theory in the last decade, however, studies on transport systems have witnessed dramatic progress. Most roads, streets, and rails are organized as a network pattern, while link flows, travel time, or geographical distance are regarded as weights. In this article, the authors will present the current state of topological research on transportation systems under a complex network framework, as well as the efforts and challenges that have been made in the last decade. First, different kinds of transportation systems should be generalized as networks in different ways, which will be explained in the first part of this paper. We follow this by summarizing network measures that describe topological characteristics of transportation networks. Then we discuss the empirical observations from the last decade on real transportation systems at a variety of spatial scales. This paper concludes with some important challenges and open research frontiers in this field.},

As the infrastructure of aviation industry, the airport network is one of the most important indicators of economic growth. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the Chinese airport network (CAN) via complex network theory. It is found that although the topology of CAN has remained steady during the past few years, there are many dynamic switchings inside the network, which have changed the relative importance of airports and airlines. Moreover, we investigate the evolution of traffic flow (passengers and cargoes) on CAN. It is found that the traffic continues to grow in an exponential form and has evident seasonal fluctuations. We also found that cargo traffic and passenger traffic are positively related but the correlations are quite different for different kinds of cities.},

	abstract = {Major airports are already at risk of coastal flooding. Sea level rise associated with a global mean temperature rise of 2 °C would place 100 airports below mean sea level, whilst 1238 airports are in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone. A global analysis has assessed the risk to airports in terms of expected annual disruption to routes. The method integrates globally available data of airport location, flight routes, extreme water levels, standards of flood protection and scenarios of sea level rise. Globally, the risk of disruption could increase by a factor of 17–69 by 2100, depending on the rate of sea level rise. A large number of airports are at risk in Europe, Norther American and Oceania, but risks are highest in Southeast and East Asia. These coastal airports are disproportionately important to the global airline network, by 2100 between 10 and 20\% of all routes are at risk of disruption. Sea level rise therefore poses a systemic risk to global passenger and freight movements. Airports already benefit from substantial flood protection that reduces present risk by a factor of 23. To maintain risk in 2100 at current levels could cost up to \$57BN. Although the cost of protecting larger airports is higher, busier airports are typically well protected and more likely to have better access to adaptation finance. However, 995 coastal airports operate 5 commercial routes or fewer. More detailed consideration of these airports shows that regions, especially low lying islands, will experience disproportionate impacts because airports can provide important economic, social, and medical lifelines. Route disruption was used as the risk metric due to its global coverage and relationship with direct economic impacts. Further work should collate a wider range of impact metrics that reflect the criticality of an airport in terms of the isolation and socio-economic context of the location it serves.},

While America and North Asia focused on regional hub developments, serving short- to medium-haul routes, West Europe, South East Asia and Middle East focused on developing their major airports into global hubs.

We demonstrate that these anomalies arise because of the multicommunity structure of the network. We identify the communities in the air transportation network and show that the community structure cannot be explained solely based on geographical constraints and that geopolitical considerations have to be taken into account. We identify each city's global role based on its pattern of intercommunity and intracommunity connections, which enables us to obtain scale-specific representations of the network.},

To this end, suitable metrics are required to assess the role of the interconnections between the elements and complex network science provides several network metrics to evaluate the network functioning. Here we focus on centrality and causality metrics measuring, respectively, the importance of a node and the propagation of disturbances along links. By investigating a dataset of US flights, we show that existing centrality and causality metrics are not suited to characterise the effect of delays in the system. We then propose generalisations of such metrics that we prove suited to ATM applications. Specifically, the new centrality is able to account for the temporal and multi-layer structure of ATM network, while the new causality metric focuses on the propagation of extreme events along the system.},

	abstract = {The U.S. air transportation network (ATN) is critical to the mobility and the functioning of the United States. It is thus necessary to ensure that it is well-connected, efficient, robust, and secure. Despite extensive research on its topology, the temporal evolution of the network’s robustness remains largely unexplored. In the present paper, a methodology is proposed to identify long-term trends in the evolution of the network’s topology and robustness over time. The study of the U.S. domestic ATN’s robustness was performed based on annual flight data from 1996 to 2016 and network analytics were used to examine the effects of restructuring that followed the 9/11 events. Centrality measures were computed and a node deletion method was applied to assess the network’s tolerance to a targeted attack scenario. The outcome of this study indicated that the 9/11 terrorist attacks triggered vast restructuring of the network, in terms of efficiency and security. Air traffic expanded, as new airports and air routes were introduced, allowing the network to recover rapidly and become more efficient. Security concerns resulted in significant improvement of the network’s robustness. Since 2001, the global traffic and topological properties of the U.S. ATN have displayed continuous growth, due to the network’s expansion. On the other hand, the results suggest that although the system’s ability to sustain its operational level under extreme circumstances has lately improved, its tolerance to targeted attacks has deteriorated. The presented methodology has shown its potential to be applied on different network levels or different transportation networks, in order to provide a general perspective of the system’s vulnerabilities.},
