This study project investigates the spatial structure and disruptive event resilience of the global air traffic network across various spatial scales using data about airports and flight routes while also incorporating additional metrics about economic wealth and travel restrictions. A general analysis of the network was conducted to give an overview of the central nodes and community structure to support further analysis. Air traffic risk scores in the case of potential local catastrophes were calculated for different countries and regions based on outgoing routes per capita, airport density and visa restrictions. The findings reveal significant variability in risk scores while also identifying key airports and countries that play crucial roles in interregional connectivity. The analysis also highlights a strong correlation between air traffic risk scores and the economic wealth of countries.

The study provides valuable insights into safe areas with high catastrophe resilience and contrary into regions with potential vulnerabilities. Future research could further refine the methodology by incorporating additional parameters such as flight frequency, and environmental variables, enhancing the understanding of the air traffic network's robustness. These enhancements could lead to more targeted strategies to mitigate the impacts of potential disruptive events, ultimately contributing to a more resilient global air travel system as a result.
